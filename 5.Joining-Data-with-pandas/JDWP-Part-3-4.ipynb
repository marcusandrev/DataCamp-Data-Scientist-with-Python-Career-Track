    "\n",
    "Being able to combine and work with multiple datasets is an essential skill for any aspiring Data Scientist. Pandas is a crucial cornerstone of the Python data science ecosystem, with Stack Overflow recording 5 million views for pandas questions. Learn to handle multiple DataFrames by combining, organizing, joining, and reshaping them using pandas. You'll work with datasets from the World Bank and the City Of Chicago. You will finish the course with a solid skillset for data-joining in pandas."

    "## Steps of a semi-join\n",
    "In the last video, you were shown how to perform a semi-join with pandas. In this exercise, you'll solidify your understanding of the necessary steps. Recall that a semi-join filters the left table to only the rows where a match exists in both the left and right tables.\n",

    "In our music streaming company dataset, each customer is assigned an employee representative to assist them. In this exercise, filter the employee table by a table of top customers, returning only those employees who are not assigned to a customer. The results should resemble the results of an anti-join. The company's leadership will assign these employees additional training so that they can work with high valued customers."
